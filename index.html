      <p>Hi there! This purpose of this website is to demonstrate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I've learned so far.</p>
      <p>I am from the beautiful country of Indonesia. You've probably heard of Bali, but that's just one (very touristy) island on this archipelago of 17,000+ islands. Below is a random list of some places I've been in Indonesia. Click on each image to learn more about each place!</p>
